                    <h3>5. Effect of Cancellation & Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>1. If you cancel your order in accordance with these terms and conditions, we will reimburse to you all payments we have received from you in respect of the returned Products including any applicable costs of delivery to you except for the supplementary costs arising if you chose a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us.</p>
                    <p>2. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for any loss in value of any Products supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling.  Unnecessary handling is any handling over and above what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functionality of the products (i.e what you would do in a shop to inspect the products prior to purchase). For the avoidance of doubt, we will not refund Product(s) which have been opened or tampered with or which have been consumed in whole or in part (unless the Products are defective and such defect was only apparent on opening of the Product). It is your responsibility to ensure Products are returned in suitable packaging, we will make a deduction from the reimbursement of any items returned damaged if they are not suitably packaged.</p>
                    <p>3. Please note that we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the Products back or you have supplied evidence of having sent the Products back, whichever is the earliest. We will then reimburse you within 14 days of the earlier of these two events using the same means of payment used for the initial transaction, unless you have agreed otherwise.</p>
                    <p>4. We may have to cancel an order before the Products are delivered, due to an event outside our control or the unavailability of stock. We will promptly contact you if this happens. If we have to cancel an order and you have made any payment in advance for Products that have not been delivered to you, we will refund these amounts to you.</p>
                    <div>
                        <p>5. Return of Faulty Products</p>
                        <p>1&#41;We are under a legal obligation to supply products that conform to the Contract. Therefore, if the Products delivered are not of satisfactory quality or do not conform to the description provided or any of these terms upon delivery, you may cancel the Contract and obtain a full refund (including a refund of the delivery charges for sending the item to you and the cost incurred by you in returning the item to us) by returning the faulty Products to us at Twinings Direct, Unit 13, 15 Trench Road, Mallusk, BT36 4TY, UK within 6 months from the date of purchase. On notifying Twinings of your faulty Products, please provide proof of purchase (providing your order number will be satisfactory).</p>
                        <p>2&#41; Please note that we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the faulty Products back or you have supplied evidence of having sent the faulty Products back, whichever is the earliest. We will then reimburse you within 14 days of the earlier of these two events using the same means of payment used for the initial transaction, unless you have agreed otherwise.</p>

                    <h3>6. Availability</h3>
                    <p>1. The Products shown on Our Site are a fair representation of the actual terms, although minor details may vary.</p>
                    <p>2. All Products offered are subject to availability. We will endeavour to identify any “out of stock” products on Our Site &#45; occasionally, large or frequent orders might mean we run out of stock during the trading day. Alternative arrangements may be made with us for frequent orders over 50 cases.</p>

                    <h3>7. UK And International Deliveries</h3>

                    <h3>8. Risk And Title</h3>
                    <p>1. The Products will be at your risk from the time of signed delivery.</p>
                    <p>2. Ownership of the Products will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Products, including delivery charges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>9. Price And Payment</h3>
                    <p>1. The price of any Products will be as quoted on Our Site when you place your order, except in cases of obvious error.</p>
                    <p>2. These prices include VAT if applicable but exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due.</p>
                    <p>3. Prices may change from time to time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation. Our site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on Our Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on Our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.</p>
                    <p>4. We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Dispatch Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing.</p>
                    <p>5. Payment for all Products must be by Paypal or the following credit or debit cards, Visa, Visa Delta, Visa Electron, MasterCard, Switch, Solo and American Express. Payment will be taken at the time of ordering.</p>
                    <p>6. You undertake that the details you provide to us for the propose of ordering or purchasing Products are correct, that the credit or debit card you are using is your own and that there is sufficient funds to cover the cost of the Products or services ordered.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>10. Import Duty</h3>
                    <p>1. If you order Products from Our Site for delivery outside the UK, they may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.</p>
                    <p>2. In the event that import duties and taxes remain unpaid by you, we are under no obligation to compensate for any losses as a result of destruction or abandonment of your order.</p>
                    <p>3. Please also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
