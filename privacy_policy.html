                    <h3>5. Information you give us when you enter a competition, prize draw or promotion</h3>
                    <p>When you enter a competition, prize draw or promotion, we collect personal data from you as part of your entry. We use this to administer our competition, to communicate results where relevant and to deliver prizes. When we use your personal data for these purposes, we do so because it is necessary for us to collect and use this information for the performance of our contract with you in accordance with our promotion rules.</p>
                    <p>If you are lucky enough to win a competition, prize draw or promotion we use your data in additional ways. Unless you ask us not to, we will make your surname and county of residence available: (a) on request to anyone who sends us a self-addressed envelope within 10 weeks of the closing date of the competition; and (b) to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) if they ask us. We do this because it is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests in complying with the Code.</p>
                    <p>You have the right to object to our publication of this data. Please contact us as soon as possible, and within a week of receiving your winner’s notification if you want to object. If we haven’t heard from you within a week, and we are asked to publish the information, we will do so. If you object later, we may have already published the information.</p>
                    <p>Where we are asked to disclose information to the ASA, and you object before we have disclosed the information, we will take into account your reasons for objecting although we may still be required to disclose this information, if for example, we are required to demonstrate that a valid award took place.</p>
                    <p>We will also write to winners to request agreement to reasonable publicity and the use of winners’ initial, surname, county of residence and any images provided as part of that publicity (e.g. photos) to publicise your win and our brand on our website and any of our social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Youtube. We will also write to request agreement to the creation of further materials based on competition entries which will be hosted on www.twinings.co.uk. We use your information in this way on the basis of your consent (which we will ask for). You can withdraw your consent at any time after you’ve agreed but please bear in mind that, due to the nature of social media, this information will have been public and potentially copied or otherwise further distributed beyond our control.</p>
                    <div>
                        <p>How long do we keep this information for?</p>
                        <p>Information we hold in connection with the management of competitions, prize draws, and promotions is usually held for 6 years although any publicity information mentioned above may be held for longer if still published on our website.</p>
